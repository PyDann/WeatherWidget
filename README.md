# WeatherWidget

WeatherWidget relies on the 'ui' module in either Pyto or Pythonista in iOS. Written specifically for Pyto, only minor changes would be needed to get this running in Pythonista. 
This is meant to be run as a Widget only.
Layout has only been tested on iPhone XS Max and iPad 12.9" and to adjust the width, change the value for 'w' (It's commented in the code)
Enable iCloud sync on your devide so that WeatherWidget runs on all your devices and shares the weather data as to not abuse the api.

Requirements:
- Pyto or Pythonista for iOS
- You will need a DarkSky api key
- Lat, Lon of your location

RoadMap:
- Move from Lat, Lon coordinates to City/State
---- Easy to-do
- Using the current moon phase in conjunction with current weather for after sunset in the icon
---- The code is sort of done. It is a bit wonky. After I'm good with it, I will push it out.
- Code Commenting
---- Yea, people like that. It is pretty short code and I kept the names super straight forward... I will get around to it.
